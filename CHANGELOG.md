# Changelog
All notable changes to the Theme Lab extension will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.0] - 2025-08-09

### üîß Color Rules & Live Preview
- Normalize `#RRGGBBAA` to `rgba(r,g,b,a)` for workbench, TextMate, and semantic token colors during live preview.
- TextMate `fontStyle` normalization: remove `normal`, map `underlined`‚Üí`underline`, dedupe unknowns, and enforce stable order `italic bold underline strikethrough`.
- Semantic token `fontStyle` strings converted to boolean flags `{ italic?, bold?, underline?, strikethrough? }`; `normal` sets all flags to `false`.
 - Live preview now sets `editor.semanticTokenColorCustomizations.enabled: true` when applying rules so semantic token colors take effect immediately.
 - Added setting `themeLab.semanticTokensEnabled` and command `Theme Lab: Toggle Semantic Token Colors` to control whether semantic token colors are enabled during live preview.

### üõ°Ô∏è Webview Robustness
- Guarded `postMessage` calls in `media/app.js` to avoid runtime errors if VS Code API is unavailable.

### üßπ Maintenance
- Cleaned `package.json` (removed invalid JSON comment). Reverted `type: module` to keep Mocha tests working under CommonJS.
- Lint/build/tests: all pass (8 tests green).
